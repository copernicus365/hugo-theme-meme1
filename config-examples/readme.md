# Config readme

## Removed non-en example configs

At this time my little clone of this excellent theme (hugo-theme-meme) is only focused on my custom usage in English, for which reason I've removed the other language based configs here (for one it allows global searching of certain properties without those config hits showing). But that's probably the limit of removing i18n settings, and if anything happens with my clone growing beyond being used by my own little usage, of course we'll bring them back.

Secondly since it's the only example config now, I've moved the en config directly under the exampleSite dir from here.
